# Experiment 12(d): Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

## Aim
To write a Python program to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point using the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) approach.

---

## Algorithm

1. **Input the Number of Cities**:
   - Begin by taking the number of cities as input.
   
2. **Distance Matrix**:
   - Define the distance matrix where each element `graph[i][j]` represents the distance between city `i` and city `j`.

3. **Generate All Permutations**:
   - Generate all possible permutations of the cities excluding the starting city.
   
4. **Calculate the Total Cost for Each Permutation**:
   - For each permutation, calculate the total distance of traveling through the cities in that order, starting and ending at the initial city.
   
5. **Track the Minimum Cost**:
   - Keep track of the minimum cost and the corresponding route.

6. **Return the Best Route and Minimum Cost**:
   - Once all permutations are evaluated, return the route with the minimum cost.

7. **End the Program**:
   - Output the minimum cost and the corresponding route.
