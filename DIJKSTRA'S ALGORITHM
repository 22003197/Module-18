# Experiment 12(c): Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Aim
To write a Python program for Dijkstra's single-source shortest path algorithm.

## Algorithm

1. **Initialize Distance Array**:
   - Set the distance for all vertices to infinity (`âˆž`), except for the source vertex which is set to 0.

2. **Track Processed Vertices**:
   - Create a set `sptSet` to keep track of the processed vertices (shortest path tree).

3. **Pick the Minimum Distance Vertex**:
   - Select the vertex with the smallest distance that has not been processed.

4. **Update Adjacent Vertices**:
   - For the selected vertex, update the distances of its adjacent vertices if a shorter path is found through this vertex.

5. **Mark the Vertex as Processed**:
   - Once the vertex is processed, mark it as part of the shortest path tree.

6. **Repeat Steps**:
   - Continue the process until all vertices are processed.

7. **Print the Shortest Distances**:
   - Once all vertices are processed, print the shortest distances from the source vertex to all other vertices.
